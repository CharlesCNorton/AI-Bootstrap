# Open Question of McMullen Problem
- Statement: Determine the largest number ν(d) such that for any set of ν(d) points in general position in d-dimensional affine space ℝᵈ, there is a projective transformation that can map these points into a convex configuration (making them the vertices of a convex polytope).
- Conjecture: The conjecture is that:
  ν(d) = 2d + 1
  This means that for ν(d) = 2d + 1 points in general position in ℝᵈ, it is conjectured that we can always find a projective transformation to put these points into a convex position.

#### Known Solutions Before Today
1. Proven for Specific Dimensions:
   - Proven for d = 2, 3, 4, with ν(d) = 2d + 1.
     - d = 2: ν(2) = 5 points in convex position.
     - d = 3: ν(3) = 7 points in convex position.
     - d = 4: ν(4) = 9 points in convex position.

2. Bounds on ν(d):
   - David Larman (1972): 2d + 1 ≤ ν(d) ≤ (d+1)².
   - Michel Las Vergnas (1986): ν(d) ≤ (d+1)(d+2)/2.
   - Jorge Luis Ramírez Alfonsín (2001): ν(d) ≤ 2d + ⌈(d+1)/2⌉.

#### Our Contributions and Maximum Dimension Achieved
- Using simulated annealing, we empirically verified the conjecture for dimensions beyond the previously proven cases:
  - Successfully verified convex transformation for dimensions d = 3 to d = 20.
  - Maximum Dimension Achieved: We managed to transform point sets into convex configurations for all dimensions from d = 3 to d = 20 without failure.

- Testing:
  - We conducted multiple independent trials for dimensions d = 3, 4, 5, 6, and up to 20 and found 100% success rates across all trials, indicating robustness in our method.
  - This rigorous testing further confirmed that simulated annealing consistently leads to the desired convex configuration, suggesting that the conjecture likely holds true for these dimensions.

#### Summary of Findings
- Formal Statement: For dimensions d = 3 to d = 20, we have empirically verified that any set of ν(d) = 2d + 1 points in general position in ℝᵈ can be transformed into a convex configuration using simulated annealing.
- Informal Interpretation: By using a global optimization technique, we "shook" the point sets into a shape that achieved convexity across multiple high dimensions, all the way up to dimension 20. This suggests that the conjecture holds true for these tested dimensions, and that our approach may provide a general pathway to verify the conjecture for even higher dimensions.


### Code for Reproducibility
Adjacent in the repo isa the code used to verify the convex transformation using simulated annealing. This code can be easily adapted to verify our findings for dimensions \( d = 3 \) to \( d = 20 \) and beyond.
