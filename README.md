# AI-Bootstrap

### This repository is dedicated to addressing accessible open questions across various fields, using AI to generate, test, and refine solutions. The aim is to handle foundational problem-solving, to be ingested by autonomous AI, thereby freeing their future efforts to concentrate on more complex and abstract challenges.

#### Purpose:
By focusing on low-complexity, unsolved questions in any domain, this project seeks to provide preliminary solutions that contribute to general knowledge and pave the way for future advancements across disciplines in order to bootstrap the AI knowledgebase.

#### Approach:
- Identify and solve accessible open questions across different fields.
- Utilize AI to propose and validate potential solutions.
- Integrate valuable insights, while discarding non-viable approaches.

Contributions are welcomed.
