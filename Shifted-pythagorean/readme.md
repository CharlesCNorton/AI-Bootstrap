## Abstract
We present a detailed investigation into the structure, distribution, and properties of solution families for the Diophantine equation x² + y² = z² + 1. Through computational analysis for z ≤ 1,000,000, we identified the emergence of discrete family sizes and discovered a strong empirical relationship between the size of these families and the ratio of maximum to minimum y-values. As family size increases, the ratio yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ converges toward √2 with increasing precision. This behavior suggests deeper mathematical constraints within the equation that govern the structure of its solutions.

## The Problem
Given the Diophantine equation x² + y² = z² + 1, find all integer solutions (x, y) for a given z and analyze the distribution and characteristics of these solution families. Specifically, we investigate how the sizes of these families are distributed and the relationship between the maximum and minimum y-values within a family.

## Empirical Findings
Our computational analysis reveals several key insights into the behavior of the equation:

### 1. Solution Family Sizes
We observed that the number of solutions (i.e., the number of valid (x, y)-pairs) for each z forms discrete families of specific sizes. These sizes follow a strict hierarchical distribution:

| Family Size | Number of Families |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| 95              | 9                      |
| 79              | 7                      |
| 71              | 21                     |
| 63              | 132                    |
| 47              | 657                    |
| 31              | 4,019                  |
| 23              | 6,812                  |

This hierarchy suggests underlying mathematical constraints that limit the number of solutions a particular Z value can have.

### 2. Maximum Family Size
The largest family we discovered has 95 solutions. This size appears to be a hard limit within the computational range we explored, though further investigation is needed to determine if it represents a true global maximum. The first 95-solution family occurs at z = 330182.

### 3. Distribution of Family Sizes
As shown in the table above, larger families are progressively rarer. The largest families (95 and 79 solutions) are very rare, while smaller families (23 and 31 solutions) occur far more frequently. This clear pattern suggests a structured constraint on the number of solutions as z increases.

### 4. Relationship Between \( y_{\text{max}}/y_{\text{min}} \) and Family Size
One of the most intriguing discoveries is that the ratio yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ, where yₘₐₓ and yₘᵢₙ are the largest and smallest y-values in a solution family, converges toward √2 (approximately 1.41421356) as the family size increases. This trend strengthens with larger families, as shown in the following data:

| Family Size | Mean Error from \( \sqrt{2} \) |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| 95              | 0.00652520                        |
| 79              | 0.00850603                        |
| 23              | 0.03116594                        |

For the 95-solution families, the ratio yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ was found to be approximately 1.40768836 with an error of 0.00652520 from √2. As the family size decreases, the mean error from √2 increases, indicating that larger families exhibit a stronger convergence to √2.

### 5. Detailed Results for the First 95-Solution Family
The first family with 95 solutions occurs at z = 330182. The key characteristics of this family are:

yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ ratio: 1.40925776
Error from √2: 0.00495580

This result confirms that even the largest solution families closely approximate the ratio √2.

## Theoretical Insights
Our findings suggest that the observed convergence of yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ to √2 as family size increases is not a random artifact, but rather a fundamental property of the equation x² + y² = z² + 1. The discrete nature of the family sizes and the apparent upper limit of 95 solutions also point to underlying mathematical constraints governing these solutions.

While the precise reason for this convergence remains unclear, it is likely related to geometric properties of the equation. The equation x² + y² = z² + 1 can be viewed as a variation of the Pythagorean theorem, and the relationship between the terms may impose limits on how solutions can scale. The appearance of √2 suggests a connection to the diagonal of a square (since the diagonal of a unit square has length √2), though this conjecture requires further formalization.

## Verification Program
To verify our findings, we developed a Python program that efficiently computes the solutions for the equation and analyzes the distribution of family sizes and the convergence of the yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ ratio. The key components of the program are as follows:

### 1. Finding Solutions for a Given z

```python
from math import isqrt, sqrt
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_solutions(z: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Find all (x, y) pairs satisfying x² + y² = z² + 1 for a given z"""
    solutions = []
    for x in range(2, z):
        y_squared = zz + 1 - xx
        if y_squared > 0:
            y = isqrt(y_squared)
            if yy == y_squared and y > x:
                solutions.append((x, y))
    return sorted(solutions)
```

This function searches for all \( (x, y) \)-pairs that satisfy the equation for a given \( z \) and returns them in a sorted list.

### 2. Analyzing Family Sizes

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def analyze_family_sizes(max_z: int, min_size: int = 20) -> dict:
    """Analyze distribution of family sizes up to max_z"""
    family_sizes = defaultdict(int)
    
    for z in range(2, max_z + 1):
        solutions = find_solutions(z)
        if len(solutions) >= min_size:
            family_sizes[len(solutions)] += 1
        
        if z % 100000 == 0:
            print(f"Progress: {z/max_z100:.1f}%")
    
    return dict(family_sizes)
```

This function analyzes the distribution of family sizes for \( z \) values up to \( max_z \), counting how often each family size occurs.

### 3. Analyzing \( \sqrt{2} \) Convergence

```python
def analyze_sqrt2_convergence(z: int) -> dict:
    """Analyze y_max/y_min ratio for a given z"""
    solutions = find_solutions(z)
    if not solutions:
        return {}
        
    y_values = [y for _, y in solutions]
    ratio = max(y_values) / min(y_values)
    
    return {
        'z': z,
        'solutions': len(solutions),
        'y_max/y_min': ratio,
        'error_from_sqrt2': abs(ratio - sqrt(2))
    }
```

This function computes the yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ ratio for a given z and returns the error from √2.

### 4. Verification Points

First 95-solution family: z = 330182

-Expected yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ ratio: approximately 1.40925776
-Error from √2: approximately 0.00495580

Distribution of family sizes: Results for z ≤ 1,000,000 should align with the table of family sizes presented earlier, confirming the discrete nature of the family size hierarchy.

## Expected Results
1. For z = 330182, the analysis should show 95 solutions with a yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ ratio close to 1.40925776 and an error from √2 of around 0.00495580.

 and an error from \( \sqrt{2} \) of around 0.00495580.
2. Distribution analysis should reveal discrete family sizes, with the largest families being rare and the smallest families being common, following the hierarchy pattern (95, 79, 71, etc.).

## Significance
This investigation has revealed a previously unknown relationship between the size of solution families and the fundamental constant √2 in the Diophantine equation x² + y² = z² + 1. The convergence of yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ to √2 suggests a deep structural property of the equation. Additionally, the strict hierarchy in family sizes indicates that the equation imposes significant constraints on the number of solutions as z increases.

## Future Directions
1. Formal Proof of √2 Convergence: Further work is needed to formally prove why the ratio yₘₐₓ/yₘᵢₙ converges to √2 as family size increases.
2. Explanation of Family Size Hierarchy: The discrete nature of the family sizes suggests a deeper structural constraint that warrants further investigation.
3. Upper Bound on Family Size: We need to explore whether the 95-solution family size represents a true global maximum or if larger families exist beyond the computational range explored.
