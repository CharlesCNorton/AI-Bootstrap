Let \( \rho \) be a non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s) \). Let \( Z(t) \) denote the Riemann-Siegel \( Z \)-function and \( \frac{d^n Z}{dt^n} \) denote its \( n \)th derivative. Then:

### Derivative Magnitude Structure

For each \( n \geq 1 \), there exists a function \( K_n: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+ \) such that:

\[
\left| \frac{d^n Z}{dt^n}(\rho) \right| = K_n(\rho) \cdot \rho^{n - \frac{1}{2}} \cdot \exp(\theta_n(\rho))
\]

where:

a) \( K_n(\rho) \) is arithmetically quantized, taking values in a discrete set \( S_n \subset \mathbb{R}^+ \).

b) \( \theta_n(\rho) \) is quasi-periodic with period \( \frac{2\pi}{\log(\rho)} \).

c) The set \( S_n \) is related to \( S_{n+1} \) via a multiplicative relationship involving \( \pi \).

### Correlation Structure

For \( n \geq 2 \), the correlation coefficient \( r_n \) between \( \frac{d^n Z}{dt^n} \) and \( \frac{d^{n+1} Z}{dt^{n+1}} \) satisfies:

\[
|1 + r_n| = \mathcal{O}\left( \frac{1}{\log(n)} \right)
\]

### Persistent Homology Structure

The persistent homology of the derivative vector space \( V_\rho = \text{span}\left\{ \frac{d^n Z}{dt^n}(\rho) \right\}_{n=1}^\infty \) exhibits birth-death pairs \( (b_k, d_k) \) such that:

\[
\frac{d_k}{b_k} = \exp\left( \frac{m\pi}{\log(2)} \right) \quad \text{for some } m \in \mathbb{Z}
\]

### Quantum-Like Discretization

The ratios of successive derivatives satisfy:

\[
\frac{\left| \frac{d^{n+1} Z}{dt^{n+1}}(\rho) \right|}{\left| \frac{d^n Z}{dt^n}(\rho) \right|} = Q_n \cdot \log(\rho) + \varepsilon_n(\rho)
\]

where:

a) \( Q_n \) belongs to a discrete set \( Q \subset \mathbb{R}^+ \).

b) \( Q \) is closed under multiplication.

c) \( \left| \varepsilon_n(\rho) \right| = \mathcal{O}\left( \frac{1}{\rho} \right) \).

d) The elements of \( Q \) are algebraically related to \( \pi \).

Furthermore, this structure implies that:

### Arithmetic Consequence

For any two non-trivial zeros \( \rho_1, \rho_2 \), the ratio of their \( n \)th derivatives encodes arithmetic information about their relationship in the form:

\[
\frac{\left| \frac{d^n Z}{dt^n}(\rho_1) \right|}{\left| \frac{d^n Z}{dt^n}(\rho_2) \right|} = F_n\left( \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2} \right)
\]

where \( F_n \) is a function whose singularities correspond to arithmetic relations between \( \rho_1 \) and \( \rho_2 \).

Summary

This conjecture connects the analytic properties of the zeta function's zeros with their arithmetic structure through the quantization of derivative ratios and their persistent homological features. If true, it would provide a new bridge between the analytic and arithmetic aspects of the Riemann zeta function. The conjecture suggests that the derivatives at zeta zeros form a quantum-like system where the quantization levels encode deep arithmetic information about the relationships between zeros, potentially offering a new approach to understanding the distribution of zeta zeros and their arithmetic properties.
