(* An obstruction class is a cohomology class with additional structure *)

(* Weight function that decreases as 1/n *)

Lemma stage_weight_limit_zero:

  Rlt (Rabs (stage_weight n)) eps.
Proof.

Theorem obstruction_vanishing:
  forall obs: obstruction_class,
  exists N : nat,
  forall n : nat,
  (INR n >= INR N)%R ->
  is_vanishing {| base_class := base_class obs; stage := n |}.
