(* Reuse basic weight definitions from previous script *)
Definition weight := nat.
Definition weighted (A : Type) := (A * weight)%type.
Definition weighted_list (A : Type) := list (weighted A).

(* New: Abstract type for spaces with dimension *)
Record space := mk_space {
  carrier :> Type;
  dimension : nat  (* Simplified dimension as natural number *)
}.

(* Dimension-based weight function *)
Definition dim_weight (X : space) : weight :=
  match dimension X with
  | 0 => 1
  | S n => 1  (* Again simplified since we're using nat *)
  end.

(* Prove basic properties about dimension weights *)
Theorem dim_weight_bounded :
  forall X : space,
  dim_weight X <= 1.
Proof.
  intros X.
  unfold dim_weight.
  destruct (dimension X); auto.

(* Helper function for combining dimension and stage weights *)
Definition combine_dim_stage (X : space) (n : nat) : weight :=
  match (dim_weight X, n) with
  | (w1, 0) => w1
  | (w1, S _) => 1  (* Simplified combined weight *)
  end.

(* Prove combined weights remain bounded *)
Theorem combined_weight_bounded :
  forall (X : space) (n : nat),
  combine_dim_stage X n <= 1.
Proof.
  intros X n.
  unfold combine_dim_stage.
  destruct n; simpl.
