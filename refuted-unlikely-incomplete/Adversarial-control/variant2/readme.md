Problem Statement: We have a dynamic graph 𝐺 = ( 𝑉 , 𝐸 ) with a subset of adversarial nodes 𝑉 𝐴 ⊂ 𝑉

The objective is to determine structural properties of 𝐺 G that maximize the influence over a controllable subgraph 𝑉 𝐶 ⊂ 𝑉, even under adversarial modifications of the network. Nodes in 𝑉 𝐴 ​attempt to limit the size or growth of 𝑉 𝐶 ​by removing, modifying, or restricting edges. 

Initial Assumptions: 𝐺 is stochastic in nature—meaning it changes over time with probabilistic rules. The adversarial behavior in 𝑉 𝐴 ​ aims to minimize the influence of 𝑉 𝐶. 

Key Goal: Identify structural graph properties that consistently yield a large value for 𝑉 𝐶 despite adversarial actions from 𝑉 𝐴.
