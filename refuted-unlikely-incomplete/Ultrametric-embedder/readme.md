## Abstract

This paper addresses the challenge of embedding general graphs, which may contain complex non-hierarchical structures such as cycles and dense subgraphs, into ultrametric spaces while preserving key relational properties. We propose an influence-based hierarchical embedding method that transforms the original graph into a tree-like ultrametric structure. The approach leverages community detection, machine learning models for influence prediction, and hierarchical modeling at multiple levels to construct a globally consistent ultrametric representation. The resulting embedding maintains essential structural features of the original graph, including both hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships, and satisfies the strong triangle inequality characteristic of ultrametric spaces.

## Introduction

In graph theory and metric geometry, embedding graphs into metric spaces is a fundamental problem with applications in data analysis, machine learning, and network science. Ultrametric spaces, a special class of metric spaces satisfying the strong triangle inequality, provide a natural framework for hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic analysis due to their tree-like structure. However, many real-world graphs exhibit complex non-hierarchical relationships, including cycles, dense subgraphs, and overlapping communities, which pose significant challenges for ultrametric embedding.

This paper presents a novel method for embedding general graphs into ultrametric spaces while preserving key relational properties. The proposed approach combines community detection, influence-based metrics, and machine learning models to construct a hierarchical representation that captures both local intra-community structures and global intercommunity relationships. By verifying that the resulting distance matrix satisfies the ultrametric inequality, we demonstrate that the method successfully embeds the graph into an ultrametric space without significant loss of information.

## Problem Statement

Objective: Given a graph \( G = (V, E) \), where \( V \) is the set of vertices and \( E \) is the set of edges, and where \( G \) may contain non-hierarchical substructures such as cycles, dense subgraphs, and complex community overlaps, find a metric space \( (M, d) \) and a mapping \( f: V \rightarrow M \) such that:

1. Ultrametric Distance Function: The distance function \( d: M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+ \) is an ultrametric satisfying the strong triangle inequality:
   \[
   d(x, z) \leq \max\{ d(x, y), d(y, z) \} \quad \forall x, y, z \in M.
   \]
   
2. Preservation of Graph-Theoretic Properties: The mapping \( f \) preserves relevant properties of \( G \), minimizing the loss of information about both hierarchical and non-hierarchical structures.

3. Meaningful Representation of Non-Hierarchical Substructures: Non-hierarchical substructures of \( G \) are represented meaningfully in \( M \), ensuring that \( d \) retains key relational properties among the vertices.

4. Global Consistency: The embedding produces a globally consistent ultrametric space that allows for hierarchical representation of both intra-community and inter-community relationships.

Challenge: Embedding a complex, non-hierarchical graph into a non-Archimedean metric space (ultrametric space) while retaining as much of the original relational structure as possible, given the inherently different nature of non-hierarchical graph regions and ultrametric properties.

## Solution Approach: Influence-Based Hierarchical Embedding

To address the problem, we develop an influence-based hierarchical embedding method consisting of the following key steps:

### 1. Community Detection and Partitioning

- Objective: Partition the graph \( G \) into communities \( \{ C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_k \} \) using a community detection algorithm (e.g., modularity-based detection).
- Rationale: Each community represents a subgraph with high internal cohesion and serves as a building block for constructing localized hierarchical relationships.

### 2. Intra-Community Influence Modeling

- Compute Influence Metrics: For each community \( C_i \), calculate influence metrics for its nodes, including:
  - Degree centrality
  - Betweenness centrality
  - Closeness centrality
  - Clustering coefficient
- Machine Learning Model: Use a Random Forest Regressor to predict influence values \( I(v) \) for each node \( v \in C_i \) based on these metrics.
- Distance Matrix Construction: Create an intra-community distance matrix \( D^{\text{intra}}_{C_i} \) by translating differences in predicted influence into distances:
  \[
  d_{C_i}(u, v) = \frac{1}{1 + |I(u) - I(v)|}, \quad \forall u, v \in C_i.
  \]
- Purpose: This captures both hierarchical and non-hierarchical connections within communities.

### 3. Intercommunity Influence Representation

- Community Representatives: Select representatives \( r_i \) from each community \( C_i \) based on influence measures (e.g., nodes with the highest betweenness centrality).
- Influence Prediction: Use a Linear Regression model to predict community-level influences \( I(r_i) \) for these representatives.
- Intercommunity Distance Matrix: Construct an intercommunity distance matrix \( D^{\text{inter}} \) based on differences in predicted influence:
  \[
  d_{\text{inter}}(r_i, r_j) = \frac{1}{1 + |I(r_i) - I(r_j)|}, \quad \forall i \neq j.
  \]
- Purpose: This represents global relationships between different communities.

### 4. Combination into a Unified Distance Matrix

- Unified Distance Matrix \( D \): Combine intra-community and intercommunity distances to represent the entire graph:
  \[
  d(u, v) = \begin{cases}
  d_{C_i}(u, v), & \text{if } u, v \in C_i, \\
  d_{\text{inter}}(r_i, r_j), & \text{if } u \in C_i, v \in C_j, i \neq j.
  \end{cases}
  \]
- Purpose: This creates a hierarchical structure for the entire graph, maintaining global consistency and preserving relationships within and across different communities.

### 5. Verification of Ultrametric Properties

- Strong Triangle Inequality: Verify that the combined distance matrix \( D \) satisfies:
  \[
  d(x, z) \leq \max\{ d(x, y), d(y, z) \}, \quad \forall x, y, z \in V.
  \]
- Outcome: Empirically confirm that 100% of the node triples satisfy the ultrametric property, indicating successful embedding into an ultrametric space.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Ultrametric Space Definition

An ultrametric space \( (M, d) \) is a metric space where the distance function \( d \) satisfies the strong triangle inequality:
\[
d(x, z) \leq \max\{ d(x, y), d(y, z) \}, \quad \forall x, y, z \in M.
\]

### Embedding Function

- Mapping: \( f: V \rightarrow M \), where \( V \) is the set of vertices in graph \( G \), and \( M \) is the ultrametric space.
- Distance Function: \( d(u, v) \) is defined based on influence differences and hierarchical relationships.

### Distance Representation

For all \( u, v \in V \):
\[
d(u, v) = \begin{cases}
d_{C_i}(u, v), & \text{if } u, v \in C_i, \\
d_{\text{inter}}(r_i, r_j), & \text{if } u \in C_i, v \in C_j, i \neq j.
\end{cases}
\]

- Intra-Community Distance:
  \[
  d_{C_i}(u, v) = \frac{1}{1 + |I(u) - I(v)|}, \quad \forall u, v \in C_i.
  \]
- Intercommunity Distance:
  \[
  d_{\text{inter}}(r_i, r_j) = \frac{1}{1 + |I(r_i) - I(r_j)|}, \quad \forall i \neq j.
  \]

### Ultrametric Verification

For all \( x, y, z \in V \), verify:
\[
d(x, z) \leq \max\{ d(x, y), d(y, z) \}.
\]

## Implementation Details

To demonstrate the practical application of the proposed method, we provide an implementation using synthetic data generated by the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and standard graph analysis libraries.

### Steps:

1. Synthetic Graph Generation: Create a graph \( G \) using SBM with specified community sizes and intra-community connection probabilities.

2. Community Detection: Apply a modularity-based community detection algorithm to partition \( G \) into communities \( \{ C_i \} \).

3. Influence Modeling:
   - Intra-Community: For each community \( C_i \):
     - Compute influence metrics for nodes.
     - Train a Random Forest Regressor to predict node influences \( I(v) \).
     - Construct intra-community distance matrices \( D^{\text{intra}}_{C_i} \).
   - Intercommunity: For community representatives \( r_i \):
     - Compute influence metrics.
     - Train a Linear Regression model to predict influences \( I(r_i) \).
     - Construct intercommunity distance matrix \( D^{\text{inter}} \).

4. Distance Matrix Construction: Combine \( D^{\text{intra}}_{C_i} \) and \( D^{\text{inter}} \) into a unified distance matrix \( D \).

5. Ultrametric Verification: Verify that \( D \) satisfies the ultrametric inequality for all node triples in \( V \).

## Results

The implementation demonstrates that the proposed method effectively embeds the general graph into an ultrametric space. The verification step confirms that 100% of the node triples satisfy the strong triangle inequality. This indicates that the embedding preserves a consistent hierarchical clustering for both local intra-community structures and global intercommunity relationships.

---

## Conclusion

We have presented an influence-based hierarchical embedding method that successfully maps general graphs, including those with complex non-hierarchical structures, into ultrametric spaces. By leveraging community detection, influence metrics, and machine learning models, the approach constructs a unified distance matrix that satisfies the ultrametric inequality. This embedding preserves key relational properties of the original graph, enabling meaningful analysis within the ultrametric framework. The method addresses a significant challenge in graph theory and metric geometry, expanding the applicability of ultrametric spaces to a broader class of graphs.
