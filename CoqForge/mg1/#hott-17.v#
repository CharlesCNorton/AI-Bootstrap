(* First let's define a more concrete obstruction class structure *)
Record ObstructionClass := mkObstruction {
  (* The degree of the polynomial approximation *)
  stage : nat;
  (* A measure of uncaptured structure - should decrease with stage *)
  uncaptured : nat;
  (* Property that higher stages have less uncaptured structure *)
  stage_property : stage > 0 -> uncaptured > 0
}.

(* Now we can define the measure concretely *)
Definition obstruction_measure (o : ObstructionClass) : R :=
  nat_to_R (uncaptured o).

(* Helper lemma about successive stages *)
Lemma successive_stages_property : forall n,
  n > 0 -> S n > n.
Proof.
  intros n H.
  apply Nat.lt_succ_diag_r.
Qed.

(* The key theorem *)
Theorem obstruction_strict_decrease : 
  forall (X : MotivicSpace) (n : nat),
    Rlt (obstruction_measure (stage_obstruction (S n) X))
        (obstruction_measure (stage_obstruction n X)).
Proof.
  intros X n.
  unfold obstruction_measure.
  (* Here we need to relate stage_obstruction to our ObstructionClass *)
  (* This is where we'll need to show the connection between stages and uncaptured structure *)
  (* To be continued based on any type errors or missing pieces *)
