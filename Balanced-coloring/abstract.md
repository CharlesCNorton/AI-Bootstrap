Abstract:

This paper addresses the open problem of balanced coloring of the reciprocals of positive integers, starting with \( n = 2 \). The primary goal is to assign each integer to one of two sets, denoted as "red" and "blue," such that the discrepancy between the reciprocal sums of the two sets remains bounded as \( n \to \infty \). Specifically, given sets \( R \) and \( B \) of integers colored red and blue, respectively, the discrepancy is defined as \( D_n = S_{\text{red}}(n) - S_{\text{blue}}(n) \), where \( S_{\text{red}}(n) \) and \( S_{\text{blue}}(n) \) are the sums of the reciprocals of the red and blue sets up to the integer \( n \). The paper explores whether a deterministic strategy can ensure that \( D_n \) remains bounded indefinitely, and if so, what such a strategy would look like.

We propose a deterministic greedy coloring algorithm as the core solution to this problem. The proposed algorithm operates by iteratively assigning each successive integer to either the red or blue set in a manner that minimizes the current discrepancy at each step. Specifically, for each integer \( i \geq 2 \), the greedy algorithm calculates two potential discrepanciesâ€”one for adding \( i \) to the red set and one for adding \( i \) to the blue set. The integer is then assigned to the set that results in the smaller absolute discrepancy. This greedy strategy is both computationally efficient and conceptually simple, focusing on local minimization of discrepancy to maintain overall balance over the sequence.

To rigorously demonstrate the efficacy of this greedy algorithm, we develop a formal proof by induction. In this proof, we establish an invariant that bounds the discrepancy \( D_n \) by a constant \( C \) for all \( n \geq 2 \). This proof utilizes both potential functions (defined as the absolute discrepancy, \( \Phi(n) = |D_n| \)) and energy functions (defined as \( E(n) = D_n^2 \)) to analyze the discrepancy's evolution over time. The proof shows that the discrepancy either remains constant or decreases, thereby ensuring that it does not diverge as \( n \) increases, even though the harmonic series itself diverges.

The effectiveness of the deterministic greedy strategy is further validated through a series of large-scale empirical experiments. We implemented the algorithm for different types of sequences, including natural numbers, odd numbers, multiples of three, and prime numbers, with values of \( n \) extending up to \( 10^8 \). Our results show that, across all these sequences, the discrepancy remains tightly controlled and often converges towards zero, indicating the robustness of the greedy strategy. The empirical findings also reveal that the energy function tends to decrease or stabilize over time, suggesting that the discrepancy correction mechanism inherent in the greedy approach is effective at maintaining a long-term balance between the red and blue sets.

Additionally, we explored an alternative solution using a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) approach to evaluate whether machine learning could yield an improved strategy for minimizing the discrepancy. The DQN model was structured to learn an optimal policy by treating the sequence assignment process as a sequential decision-making problem. We used a neural network to approximate the Q-function, and the network was trained using advanced reinforcement learning techniques, including experience replay and GPU acceleration. Despite these sophisticated enhancements, the DQN-based hybrid coloring strategy was found to be computationally costly and exhibited inconsistent convergence patterns. The discrepancy control achieved by the DQN approach did not significantly outperform the deterministic greedy algorithm, and the computational overhead of training the model and tuning hyperparameters was substantial. Thus, we concluded that the overhead associated with the DQN approach outweighed any potential benefits, particularly in light of the strong performance of the simple greedy strategy.

To further explore the behavior of the discrepancy sequence, we conducted a probabilistic analysis using stochastic process simulations. The discrepancy sequence was modeled as a random walk, with simulations used to test whether the discrepancy remains bounded under probabilistic coloring decisions. We performed \( 8000 \) independent simulations, each consisting of \( 300000 \) steps, to compute the mean and standard deviation of the discrepancy sequence. Using Azuma-Hoeffding bounds, we derived confidence intervals that indicated that the discrepancy remained controlled, aligning with our findings from the deterministic approach. This probabilistic validation provides further support for the hypothesis that the discrepancy does not diverge, even though the underlying harmonic series is divergent.

A key contribution of this research is the formal proof, complemented by empirical evidence, that demonstrates the effectiveness of the deterministic greedy algorithm in maintaining bounded discrepancy for an infinite sequence of reciprocals. The proof is structured around a rigorous inductive argument that establishes the boundedness of the discrepancy at each step, while the empirical analysis covers a range of different sequences and validates the performance of the algorithm for large values of \( n \). The combination of mathematical rigor and empirical data provides a compelling case for the efficacy of the greedy strategy.

Our work also provides critical insights into the limitations of reinforcement learning-based approaches for this class of discrepancy problems. The DQN approach, while theoretically promising, required significant computational resources and yielded results comparable to the deterministic approach, thereby illustrating the practical challenges of using reinforcement learning in scenarios where simple heuristic algorithms suffice. This observation highlights the value of deterministic strategies in combinatorial discrepancy problems and provides guidelines for researchers considering machine learning for similar applications.

The findings contribute to the broader field of discrepancy theory by providing a comprehensive examination of both deterministic and probabilistic coloring strategies for balancing reciprocal sums. The deterministic greedy algorithm, with its simplicity and computational efficiency, offers a robust solution that outperforms more complex machine learning methods in this context. Our analysis suggests that straightforward deterministic algorithms can effectively address balancing problems that might initially appear to require sophisticated optimization techniques. This study also underscores the importance of combining formal proof, empirical validation, and comparative analysis to thoroughly evaluate potential solutions to complex mathematical problems.
